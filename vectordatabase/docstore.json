Whilst packagings used for the transport of radioactive material must provide protection from radiation, there is likely to be residual activity from packages offered for air transport. (B) A Transport Index (TI) is a number which represents the level of radiation at a distance of 1 meter, assigned to a single package, overpack or freight container. The TI is used to provide control over radiation exposure, to determine categories of radioactive material for the purposes of labelling, declaration, etc. to determine whether transport under exclusive use is required and to determine spacing requirements during storage and transport. The TI for each overpack or freight container must be determined as either the sum of the transport indices of all the packages contained, or by direct measurement of radiation level.

The TI for each overpack or freight container must be determined as either the sum of the transport indices of all the packages contained, or by direct measurement of radiation level. (C) Separation From Persons: Categories II \u2014 Yellow and III \u2014 Yellow packages, overpacks or freight containers must be separated from persons. The minimum separation distances in the following table that are to be applied are based upon the sum of TIs and these distances are from the surface of the packages, overpacks or freight containers to the nearest inside surface of the passenger cabin or flight deck partitions or floors, irrespective of the duration of the carriage of the radioactive material. If the packages, overpacks or freight containers are separated into groups, the minimum distance from the nearest inside surface of the passenger cabin or flight deck partitions or floors to each group is the distance applicable to the sum of the TIs within the individual groups, provided that each group is separated from each other group by at least three times the distance applicable to the one that has the larger sum of TIs. Alternative separation distances apply when radioactive material is being carried by a cargo aircraft and in those circumstances the minimum distances must be applied as above and also to any other areas occupied by persons. Whether carried on a passenger or cargo aircraft, in accordance with the practice of keeping exposure to radiation as low as reasonably achievable, separation distances should be extended whenever feasible. (D) Separation From Other Radioactive Packages: The minimum distance between two radioactive packages is three times the minimum distance needed for the package with the highest TI.  Example: Package 1- TI: 5.5-  the minimum distance required from the upper surface of the package to the ceiling of compartment is 1.15m (refer to the TI table below). If the height of the package is 50 cm, then a compartment height of 1.65m (1.15+0.5) is needed.  Package 2- TI: 4.2- the minimum distance required from the upper surface of the package to the ceiling of compartment is 1 m. Since package 1 has the greater TI, the minimum distance between these two packages shall be 3.45m (3x1.15).

Performance indicators for operational robustness of rosters support Turkish Airlines in the assessment of the stability of its rostering system. Performance indicators for operational robustness of rosters at least measure how often a rostered crew pairing for a duty period is achieved within the planned duration of that duty period. Crew pairing means rostered positioning and flights for crew members in one duty period. The planning of crew schedules is done according to the limitation defined in this section. The performance indicator for Turkish Airlines is the FDP limits and they are monitored before and through the crew operation and necessary actions are taken in reasonable time frame if possible.

The difference may not exceed 1 hour. The maximum daily FDP for cabin crew is based on the time at which the flight crew report for their FDP, but the FDP starts at the reporting time of the cabin crew. For reporting times, refer to Subchapter 7.1.8.1. 7.1.8.5 Night duty Night duties comply with the following: 1) When establishing the maximum FDP for consecutive night duties, the number of sectors is limited to 4 sectors per duty. 2) The Turkish Airlines applies appropriate fatigue risk management to actively manage the fatiguing effect of night duties of more than 10 hours in relation to the surrounding duties and rest periods in accordance with  Subchapter 7.1.8.5.1. 7.1.8.5.1 Appropriate Fatigue Risk Management 1) When rostering night duties of more than 10 hours (referred to below as \u2018long night duties\u2019), it is critical for the crew member to obtain sufficient sleep before such duties when he is adapted to being awake during day time hours at the local time where he is acclimatised. To optimise alertness on long night duties, the likelihood of obtaining sleep as close as possible to the start of the FDP should be considered, when rostering rest periods before long night duties, by providing sufficient time to the crew member to adapt to being awake during the night. Rostering practices leading to extended wakefulness before reporting for such duties should be avoided. Fatigue risk management principles that could be applied to the rostering of long night duties may include: (i) avoiding long night duties after extended recovery rest periods (ii) progressively delaying the rostered ending time of the FDPs preceding long night duties; \n  EK.10.73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 7 \u2013 FLIGHT TIME LIMITATIONS   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision", "doc_id": "04413720-4a66-48fe-a697-f69ca97cb290", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5fc92e85138b409b0182a657242cb6a25e8c9c913706dc7423af3ccf48abeeb5", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 41878, "end": 45297}, "relationships": {"1": "178eb8a0-d346-4ea4-9212-77dbaea58391", "2": "592e91fa-3800-402a-9b29-2b3f647a743d", "3": "3066dcec-1ebd-4b7b-9eff-7a7dbdbbf64a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3066dcec-1ebd-4b7b-9eff-7a7dbdbbf64a": {"__data__": {"text": "on long night duties, the likelihood of obtaining sleep as close as possible to the start of the FDP should be considered, when rostering rest periods before long night duties, by providing sufficient time to the crew member to adapt to being awake during the night.

When radar vectors are given, the radar controller issues clearances such that the prescribed obstacle clearance will exist at all times. When an IFR flight is being vectored by radar, ATC may assign minimum radar vectoring altitudes which are below the minimum sector altitude. Minimum vectoring altitudes provide obstacle clearance at all times until the aeroplane reaches the point where the pilot will resume own navigation. The pilot-in-command should closely monitor the aircraft\u2019s position with reference to pilot-interpreted navigation aids to minimize the amount of radar navigation assistance required and to alleviate the consequences resulting from a radar failure. The pilot-in-command should also continuously monitor communications with ATC while being radar vectored, and should immediately climb the aircraft to the minimum sector altitude if ATC does not issue further instructions within a suitable interval, or if a communications failure occurs. (B) The calculated minimum safe altitudes/heights must be adjusted when the ambient temperature on the surface is much lower than that predicted by the standard atmosphere. In such conditions, an approximate correction is 4% height increase for every 10\u00b0C below standard temperature as measured at the altimeter setting source. This is safe for all altimeter setting source altitudes for ISA temperature deviations above \u201315\u00b0C. (C) A more accurate correction should be obtained from the Low Temperature Altitude Correction Table below. Values at this table are calculated for a sea level aerodrome. They are therefore conservative when applied at higher aerodromes.

(D) Low temperature altitude correction (correction value to be added to the QNH altitude value) should be applied to ensure the aeroplane remains above the minimum altitudes when the local aerodrome OAT value is reported as \u201c0\u201d degrees Celsius or less. The pilot-in-command should add the values derived from the table to the published procedure altitudes, including MSAs, MDAs, DAs, missed approach altitudes and all other flight related altitudes (thrust reduction, acceleration, engine-out acceleration, holding, etc.)  to ensure adequate obstacle clearance.  (E) Procedures in respect to altitude corrections are as follows: (1) Accepting an IFR assigned altitude by ATC rests with the pilot-in-command. The pilot-in-command should refuse this clearance if he finds unacceptable due to low temperature. (2) Once an IFR altitude is accepted, any temperature correction must not be applied to compensate for cold temperature. (3) ATC should be informed about the amount of correction applied to any published procedure altitude.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 217 | Total Page: 623 \n(F) Low temperature altitude correction tables: Aerodrome OAT  Height above the aerodrome used for altimeter source (ft)  200 300 400 500 600 700 800 0 C +20 +20 +30 +30 +40 +40 +50 -10 C  +20 +30 +40 +50 +60 +70 +80 -20 C  +30 +50 +60 +70 +90 +100  +120  -30 C  +40 +60 +80 +100  +120  +140  +150  -40 C  +50 +80 +100  +120  +150  +170  +190  -50 C  +60 +90 +120  +150  +180  +210  +240   Aerodrome OAT  Height above the aerodrome used for altimeter source (ft)  900 1000  1500  2000  3000  4000  5000  0 C +50 +60 +90 +120  +170  +230  +280  -10 C  +90 +100  +150  +200  +290  +390  +490  -20 C  +130  +140  +210  +280  +420  +570  +710  -30 C  +170  +190  +280  +380  +570  +760  +950  -40 C  +220  +240  +360  +480  +720  +970  +1210  -50 C  +270  +300  +450  +590  +890  +1190  +1500  (G) For examples of low altitude correction, refer to Subchapter 8.1.1.4.4.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 218 | Total Page: 623 \n8.1.1.4.2 Low Pressure Altitude Correction (A) When using QNH altimeter settings, low pressure altitude correction is not required.

(B) Before an aerodrome can be used as a destination or as an alternate, it shall be classified as adequate for the types of aeroplanes which are intended to be used. (C) Aerodromes listed in LS.74.040 Aerodrome Categorisation List are  evaluated as adequate and are authorized for use by Turkish Airlines.  (D) Aerodromes not listed in LS.74.040 Aerodrome Categorisation List may be authorized for operational use by Turkish Airlines if such operations are permitted by the appropriate aerodrome authorities and authorization has been obtained in accordance with the approval and authorization process. (E) Authorized aerodromes are given categories as defined in PR.70.617 Procedure for Aerodrome Analysis and Authorization and these categories are published in LS.74.040 Aerodrome Categorisation List. Operational suitability of aerodromes as destination or alternate is checked and defined within the flight planning system. Pre-flight planning is based on operational suitability of aerodromes. (F) When deemed necessary by the Commander for the safety of the flight, any aerodrome not listed in LS.74.040 Aerodrome Categorisation List may be used after its suitability (Runway length and width, PCN value, ATC services etc.) has been confirmed by the Commander using all available resources. Operational data such as weather and NOTAM may be obtained via ACARS, HF, VHF, etc. 8.1.2.2  Approval and Authorization Process (A) Standard aerodrome approval shall be based on PR.70.617 Procedure For Aerodrome Analysis and Authorization.  (B) Before an aerodrome is authorized for use by Turkish Airlines, it shall be approved by Chief Flight Operations Officer (Nominated Person). The standart approval process is defined within PR.70.617 Procedure For Aerodrome Analysis and Authorization. (C) Using an isolated aerodrome as destination aerodrome requires the approval of the Turkish DGCA in addition to the authorization process. (D) For inaugural (initial) flights, applicable Fleet Manager shall ensure that the flight crew composition is based on qualification and experience. For this purpose flight crew composition shall consist of a minimum of two Commanders and: (1) one Commander is ranked as a CI (Commander Instructor or Examiner), and  (2)  remaining Commander is ranked as a CI, CN or C1.

If there are any specific requirements after the assessment, they will be published as a Company NOTAM for the associated airport. The variations and their validity periods shall be included in the Company NOTAM published.  4) For cases where one time on demand flights are required, IOCC shall be responsible to determine the necessary requirements based on items 1 and 3 above.  5) Lowest aerodrome RFFS category for Turkish Airlines operated aeroplane is Category 4. ARFC shall not be reduced below Category 4. 6) If an individual aerodrome serves more than one purpose, the highest required category corresponding to that purpose at the time of expected use applies. (B) In-Flight: 1) The Commander may decide to land at an aerodrome regardless of the RFFS category if, in the Commander\u2019s judgement after due consideration of all prevailing circumstances, to do so would be safer than to divert (e.g. possibility of occurrence of a more significant hazard as a result of diversion or hold). 2) The information contained about the acceptable aerodrome RFFS category at the planning stage and, the variations under item (A) 3) are applicable at the in-flight re-planning point.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 233 | Total Page: 623 \n(C) Acceptable Aerodrome RFFS Category: Minimum Acceptable Aerodrome RFFS Category  Aeroplane Type  Aeroplane RFFS \nCategory (ARFC)  Departure and \nDestination Aerodrome  \n(Note 1 ) Take -Off, En -route, \nDestination Alternate \nAerodromes  \n(Note 1  & 2) A330 -300 9 8 7 A350 -900 B777  B787", "doc_id": "c01f05bb-8410-4c5b-9085-4ea8f5ab2b60", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "89778ee6403d7d7e73f3736e989c28faa50beb8f3b793cdca7df48d11fd8cd9c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 54477, "end": 58179}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "4f77f5c4-2b6e-4f4c-84e7-1d4047dfb440", "3": "8e256d5e-7c62-428e-a1af-371a75418539"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e256d5e-7c62-428e-a1af-371a75418539": {"__data__": {"text": "the planning stage and, the variations under item (A) 3) are applicable at the in-flight re-planning point.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 233 | Total Page: 623 \n(C) Acceptable Aerodrome RFFS Category: Minimum Acceptable Aerodrome RFFS Category  Aeroplane Type  Aeroplane RFFS \nCategory (ARFC)  Departure and \nDestination Aerodrome  \n(Note 1 ) Take -Off, En -route, \nDestination Alternate \nAerodromes  \n(Note 1  & 2) A330 -300 9 8 7 A350 -900 B777  B787 -9 B777F  A330 -200F  8 7 6 A330 -200 A321  7 6 5 B737 -800/900ER  B737 -8-9 MAX  A319  6 5 4 A320  B737 -700 Non -revenue/Ferry Flight  Note 1: One more category below these values may be acceptable in the case of a temporary downgrade of 72 hours or less (not below Category 4) as indicated in the NOTAMs and Company NOTAMs. Note 2: At flight planning stage, RFFS Category for En-route Alternate Aerodromes may be reduced down to Category 4, if the conditions detailed in EK.10.74.005 Dispatch Manual Section 1.9.2.8 Monitoring of the Diverts are met.

(B) Different concepts of minima: (1) Aeroplane capability minima: Aeroplane Flight Manual (AFM) defines the lowest minima for which the aeroplane has been certified. (2) Aerodrome operating minima: Jeppesen aerodrome charts are established in accordance with respective national authority minima for aerodromes. (3) Turkish Airlines minima: This is the lowest minima to which Turkish Airlines is authorized to use at a specific aerodrome. This minimum cannot be lower than items (1) and (2) above. 8.1.3.2 The Method for Establishing Aerodrome Operating Minima (A) Aerodrome operating minima shall be established for each departure, destination or alternate aerodrome planned to be used. As an integral part of EK.10.73.002 Operations Manual Part-C, Jeppesen Airway Manual establishes and publishes the required aerodrome operating minima on behalf of Turkish Airlines.  (B) These minima shall not be lower than those established for such aerodromes by the State in which the aerodrome is located, except when specifically approved by that State. Any increment specified by the competent authority shall be added to the published minima. (C) Following factors are taken into account when establishing aerodrome operating minima:  (1) type, performance and handling characteristics of the aircraft; (2) composition, competence and experience of the flight crew; (3) dimensions and characteristics of the runways/final approach and take-off areas (FATOs) that may be selected for use; (4) adequacy and performance of the available visual and non-visual ground aids; (5) equipment available on the aircraft for the purpose of", "doc_id": "da3d8834-f725-4eab-a188-2f7afe4089ae", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8a9870956991fc4887212a1e627ef7ef98a4a30dda881c54dd0909f923f17e1a", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 68359, "end": 72022}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "b880cdd8-ea19-409d-a02b-467f951a7cc1", "3": "c60ddddd-06f4-4086-b11a-badd95de00fe"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c60ddddd-06f4-4086-b11a-badd95de00fe": {"__data__": {"text": "operating minima on behalf of Turkish Airlines.

(B) Aircraft that will execute a side\u2212step maneuver will be cleared for a specified approach procedure and landing on the adjacent parallel runway. Example, \u201ccleared ILS runway 07L approach, side\u2212step to runway 07R.\u201d Pilots are expected to commence the side\u2212step maneuver upon reaching minimums according to below item (D) provided that the runway or runway environment is in sight. Compliance with minimum altitudes associated with stepdown fixes is expected even after the side\u2212step maneuver is initiated. (C) The final approach track may not be aligned with the runway. In such cases, additional visibility/RVR should be required in order to allow the pilot sufficient time to assess the position of the aircraft relative to the runway. In the case of a side-step manoeuvre, where the aircraft will manoeuvre at a relatively late stage toward a parallel runway, additional visibility/RVR should also be required. (D) Complying with all of the above items whether the approach track is aligned with the runway or not, Company minima for side step manoeuvre according to executed instrument approach are as below:  Visibility (m) * 5000 or Circle to Land / Sidestep Minimum  MDA (ft) * AAL+1000  or Circle to Land / Sidestep Minimum   *: Whichever is higher (E) After being established on the final approach course of the runway which instrument approach procedure is executed, continue to descent until side step MDA according to item (D) above.

(B) Unless seat allocation is applied and the effects of the number of passengers per seat row, cargo in individual cargo compartments and fuel in individual tanks is accounted for accurately in the balance calculation, operational margins must be applied to the certificated center of gravity envelope. (C) Large CG errors may occur when free seating (freedom of passengers to select any seat when entering the aeroplane) is permitted. Although in most cases reasonably even longitudinal passenger seating can be expected, there is a risk of an extreme forward or aft seat selection causing very large and unacceptable CG errors (assuming that the balance calculation is done on the basis of an assumed even distribution). The largest errors may occur at a load factor of approximately 50% if all passengers are seated in either the forward or aft half of the cabin. If extreme longitudinal seat selection occurs, Commander shall apply corrective action by instructing the cabin crew members to reposition the passengers in the cabin as required.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 274 | Total Page: 623 \n8.1.9 ATS Flight Plan 8.1.9.1 General (A) An ATS IFR flight plan shall be submitted to the appropriate ATS unit for all flights.

When the waypoint is the FIRST waypoint on the routing then the AWY and MOCA are replaced by the Runway Threshold Elevation. Note: Runway threshold elevation can only be shown for departure airport (not destination airport in the alternate nav-log, which shows ARP elevation). When the waypoint is the LAST waypoint on the routing then the AWY and MOCA are supplemented by the threshold Elevation. WPT, FRQ, NAME/FIR, LAT/LONG: Waypoint name, if waypoint is a navigational aid its frequency, and coordinates of waypoint and FIR name.  ARINC Waypoint name: If waypoint is either departure or destination airport, ICAO ID of that airport followed immediately by the runway ID If waypoint is an alternate airport, ICAO ID of airport. Pseudo-waypoints will be labeled as follows: TOC: Top Of Climb. TOD: Top Of Descent. S/C: Top of climb (enroute step climb). S/D: Top of descent (enroute step descent). S/C and S/D waypoints are followed by the FL to be climbed/descended to in brackets. IA1: ETP\u2019s (Equal Time Points) between IA airports.

CRITICAL FUEL SCENARIO (IA-ETOPS-EROPS) INFORMATION: If a flight\u2019s routings takes it beyond THT (Threshold Time, normally 60 minutes for a twin engine A/C) from an adequate airport then the system performs an ETOPS analysis and covers that \u201cETOPS\u201d portion of the routing with Suitable \u201cEA\u201d airports. It will also perform critical fuel analysis for that portion of flight according to the EA availability and display the results on this page.  The system handles both \u201cBalanced\u201d and \u201cUnbalanced\u201d ETOPS planning. Unbalanced ETOPS is where the last Adequate (IA, 60minute) airport before the ETOPS Entry and/or the last IA airport after exiting the ETOPS segment of flight are NOT suitable for use as EA airports. In these cases ETPs may not be generated and ETOPS critical fuel is based upon diversion to the suitable EA airport from either the EEP (ETOPS Entry Point) or EXP (ETOPS Exit Point).  ETOPS 60/180: THT (threshold time) and MDT (Maximum Diversion Time) used by system \u2013 which may be less than the real MDT if Variable MDT is used. TAS 426/414: TAS\u2019s from subtype record which, when combined with THT and MDT, define the radius of the IA and EA circles. Note: The TAS\u2019s are static for each A/C subtype and DO NOT determine the actual speeds used when the system calculates the critical fuel. 28. CRITICAL FUEL SCENARIO: The format of the ETOPS Critical fuel tables is always the same. Three different tables may be generated, labeled as follows: EEP: ETOPS Entry Point. This shows the critical fuel results for diversion from the EEP to the IA airport and, if \u201cUnbalanced\u201d ETOPS is applied (that IA is not also Suitable), results to the protecting EA airport in the second row. ETP: Equal Time Point. Generated between consecutive EA airports showing results of critical fuel analysis from the ETP to each EA airport. EXP: ETOPS Exit Point. This shows the critical fuel results for diversion from EXP to the next IA airport and in the event that of Unbalanced ETOPS (where the IA is not also suitable) results to the protecting EA. Go XXXX: Name and type of waypoint (waypoint name is GOXXXX \u2013 ICAO ID of airport for diversion). ALTN: ICAO ID\u2019s of the EA\u2019s/IA\u2019s. EEP or ETP OR EXP COORD: Coordinates of EEP/ETP/EXP. ALTN: ICAO ID of IA/EA airport. GCD: Great Circle Distance from ETP to appropriate EA/IA airport.

(B) Usage of mixed fuel is only permissible as specified within the limitations section of the applicable aeroplane AFMs. (C) Various types of jet engine fuels are permissible for usage, refer to applicable FCOMs: (1) Kerosene type fuels: JET A, JET A1, and JP 8. (2) Wide-cut type fuels: JET B and JP4 (low flash point which are not widely used).  (D) A major concern when mixing fuels is the fuel air mixture that develops in the space above the fuel inside the tank. When wide-cut fuel and kerosene type fuels are being mixed, the fuel vapour mixture with air is in the explosive or ignitable envelope throughout the range of ground temperature. (E) Greater precautions shall be observed when refueling an aeroplane with wide-cut fuel types where the fuel tanks already contain kerosene type fuels. 8.2.1.5.1 Precautions With Wide-Cut Fuels (A) Wide-cut fuel usage shall be subject to approval of", "doc_id": "6e6524e6-15dd-4272-8176-7062d4bd9ec1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fe0e4eb246d83146aa7b603a43e7d8742ab5201013e27c74a21ebc5e93ebb24c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 277743, "end": 280810}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "33389320-b47b-4520-9aeb-2138b3ccb7f6", "3": "b9c3e05c-b6c4-46aa-9959-63066f5a84f5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9c3e05c-b6c4-46aa-9959-63066f5a84f5": {"__data__": {"text": "fuels are being mixed, the fuel vapour mixture with air is in the explosive or ignitable envelope throughout the range of ground temperature. (E) Greater precautions shall be observed when refueling an aeroplane with wide-cut fuel types where the fuel tanks already contain kerosene type fuels. 8.2.1.5.1 Precautions With Wide-Cut Fuels (A) Wide-cut fuel usage shall be subject to approval of Senior Vice President, Flight Operations (Chief Pilot). (B) Boeing does not permit the use of wide-cut fuels on the B737 aeroplanes. (C) Turkish Airlines aeroplanes shall not be fuelled with wide-cut fuel or any mixture thereof, while the passengers are onboard, embarking, or disembarking. (D) When refueling with wide-cut fuels, the aeroplane\u2019s electrical system or supply shall be selected \u201cOFF\u201d prior to commencing refueling and remain \u201cOFF\u201d until refueling has been completed and the hoses have been disconnected. (E) When wide-cut fuel is used, it shall be recorded in the aeroplane technical log. The next two uplifts (non-wide-cut fuel) of fuel shall also be treated as being wide-cut fuel. (F) Over wing refueling is not permitted when wide-cut fuels are involved. (G) When refueling with wide-cut fuels, fuel filling rates shall be reduced by 50% of the normal filling rate. 8.2.1.5.2 Mixed Fuel Freezing Point Determination (A) The freezing point of any fuel mixture will vary.  (B) Fuel freezing points of fuel mixtures are particularly more of a concern when operating transatlantic, transpacific, and Siberian routes and when very low OAT are expected. (C)  The limiting freezing point value of the mixture should be considered, if the mixture ratio of the highest freezing point fuel is more than 10%.  Apply the following example: (1) When the mixture contains less than 10% of JET A and more than 90% JET A1, the fuel shall be considered as JET A1 (typically -47\u00b0C) . (2) When the mixture contains more than 10% of JET A and less than 90% JET A1, the fuel shall be considered as JET A (typically -40\u00b0C). \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 325 | Total Page: 623 \n(3) When in doubt; use the most conservative freezing point of the fuel on board as the freezing point of the fuel mixture ((typically for JET A -40\u00b0C). (D) To achieve the best dilution, apply the following example: (1) All of the JET A (making up the lesser of the fuel to be mixed) should be transferred in to the inner wing tanks prior to refueling. This procedure will enable a maximum dilution but does not guarantee that the mixture will be consistent.  (2) During normal operational procedures, the JET A fuel in the inboard tanks will be consumed first by the engines. Thus, the concentration of the remaining JET A fuel on board, later in flight when low fuel temperatures are encountered, will be less than at takeoff. Low concentrations of JET A in JET A1 will have a freezing point similar to JET A1 and can be treated as JET A1 with respect to the cold fuel alert. 8.2.1.6 Refuelling/Defuelling Responsibilities (A) Upon being advised of the actual or estimated ZFW, the Commander shall determine the fuel type and final fuel figure in accordance with", "doc_id": "b9c3e05c-b6c4-46aa-9959-63066f5a84f5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e118fbd44752fb9e825c12b6b458f3381078869d27c0aaee693cace8ce7a9164", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 280801, "end": 284065}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "6e6524e6-15dd-4272-8176-7062d4bd9ec1", "3": "564c01ad-a29f-4266-953a-33d543d008b8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "564c01ad-a29f-4266-953a-33d543d008b8": {"__data__": {"text": "low fuel temperatures are encountered, will be less than at takeoff.

(F) If the total amount of fuel uplifted exceeds the amount of fuel requested by the Commander, the Commander shall be notified immediately. To avoid any unnecessary delays (defueling) caused by the excess fuel, the Commander shall re-evaluate the performance parameters to ensure that the flight is not subject to any performance restrictions. If performance restrictions are applicable, the Commander shall notify the appropriate personnel for the defueling process.

(C) The following fluids may be used for anti-icing: (1) mixture of water and Type I fluid; (2) Type I fluid; (3) Type II fluid, Type III fluid, or Type IV fluid; (4) mixture of water and Type II fluid, Type III fluid, or Type IV fluid. Note: De-icing fluids must be heated to ensure a temperature of 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F) minimum at the nozzle. (D) Type I fluids (unthickened type): (1) As for effective anti-icing an even layer and thickness of fluid is required over the prescribed aeroplane surfaces.  (2) Type I fluids provide only limited holdover effectiveness. For longer anti-icing protection, undiluted, unheated Type II or Type IV fluids shall be used. (3) After the de-icing process with Type I,  (a) If precipitation is not encountered, refer to LS.67.046 Guidelines for De-icing and Anti-icing on Ground Table 3 Active Frost holdover times (Type I fluid provides a holdover time of 0:35 min when no precipitation is present). (b) If precipitation is encountered, then refer to LS.67.046 Guidelines for De-icing and Anti-icing on Ground Table 4 Holdover Times for SAE Type I Fluid on Critical Aircraft Surfaces Composed Predominantly of Aluminium or Table 5 Holdover Times for SAE Type I Fluid on Critical Aircraft Surfaces Composed Predominantly of Composites, depending on the structure type of the aeroplane. (E) Type II, Type III and Type IV fluids (thickened type):  (1) Fluids based on alcohol are prohibited because they can cause window crazing. (2) The higher viscosity of Type II fluids and Type IV fluids have the advantage of alonger holdover time but may cause problems to aeroplane types with a low liftoff speed due to the viscous properties of the treatment.  \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 346 | Total Page: 623 \n(3) The low lift-off speed might not be sufficient to allow the fluid to \"runback\" and disappear from the aerofoil. As a consequence the centre of pressure will change, resulting in a delayed rotation and liftoff. It is therefore imperative to check the instructions in the Operations Manual Part-B and the crew memorandums for winter operation. (4) When thickened fluids are used, spraying near the flight deck windows must be avoided, as fluid can cause a severe loss of visibility. Any thickened fluid remaining on the nose areas where it could blow back onto the windscreens should be removed prior to departure, using a diluted Type I fluid, squeegees, or equivalent. If flight deck windows are contaminated with thickened fluids, use water or an approved windshield cleaner (use of a low windscreen washing fluid is recommended when OAT is at or below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F)). * CAUTION: Prior to cleaning of the flight deck windows, ensure that the window heating system is switched off.

It is therefore important that surfaces are closely examined following each de-icing operation, in order to ensure that all deposits have been removed. (B) Significant deposits of clear ice can form, in the vicinity of the fuel tanks, on wing upper surfaces as well as under-wing. Aeroplanes are most vulnerable to this type of build-up when: (1) wing temperatures remain well below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F) during the turnaround/transit; (2) ambient temperatures between -2 \u00b0C and +15 \u00b0C (28 \u00b0F and 59 \u00b0F) are experienced; (3) ambient humidity is high and/or precipitation occurs while the aeroplane is on the ground. (C) This type of ice formation is extremely difficult to detect. However, frost or ice on the lower surface of either wing can indicate the presence of clear ice on the upper wing surfaces.

This check shall cover wings, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer and fuselage, plus all other parts of the aeroplane on which a de-icing/anti-icing treatment was performed. (1) The check shall be performed from points offering sufficient visibility of all prescribed surfaces (e.g. from the de-icer itself or other equipment suitable for gaining access). Any contamination found, shall be removed by further de-icing/anti-icing treatment and the check repeated. (2) Before take-off, the commander must ensure that he has received confirmation that this post de-icing/ anti-icing check has been accomplished. (3) Where the de-icing provider is carrying out the de-icing/anti-icing process and also the post de-icing/ anti-icing check, it may either be performed as a separate check or incorporated into the de-icing operation as defined below: (a)  as the de-icing/ anti-icing operation progresses the de-icing operator will closely monitor the surface receiving treatment, in order to ensure that all forms of frost, ice, slush or snow (except as may be allowed in the AFM and/or AMM) are removed; \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 349 | Total Page: 623 \n(b)  once the operation has been completed, the de-icing operator will carry out a close visual check of the surface where treatment commenced, in order to ensure it has remained free of contamination (this procedure is not required under \u2018frost only\u2019 conditions); (c)  where the request for de-icing/anti-icing did not specify all of the following surfaces, i.e. wing, horizontal stabilizer, vertical stabilizer and fuselage, the surfaces omitted from the request shall also receive a close visual check at this time, in order to confirm that they have also remained free of contamination; and (d)  any evidence of contamination that is outside the defined limits shall be reported to the commander immediately. (D) Pre-Takeoff Check: The commander shall continually monitor the weather conditions after the performed de-icing/anti-icing treatment.

(1) This check is normally performed from inside the flight deck.  (2) This check shall be accomplished as close to the time of takeoff as possible. (3) When deemed necessary by the commander, the check may be conducted from  within  the  aeroplane by visually  checking  the  wings or other surfaces by the commander himself or a flight crew member designated by the commander. (a)  Where, before commencing takeoff, a crew member of an aircraft observes that there is frost, ice or snow adhering to the wings of the aircraft, the crew member shall immediately report that observation to the commander, and the commander or a flight crew member designated by the commander shall inspect the wings of the aircraft before takeoff. In such a case, the commander shall ensure that leaving and entering the flight deck for the purpose of the pre-take-off check is in compliance with the flight deck door principles stipulated in Chapter 10 and Subchapter 8.3. (4) Before an aircraft is de-iced or anti-iced or visually inspected from within the aircraft, the commander of the aircraft shall ensure that the crew members and passengers are informed of the decision to do so. (5) The commander of the flight shall make the proper arrangements for the pre-takeoff check. The commander: (a) shall monitor the weather conditions after the de-icing and/ or anti-icing treatment and  be sure that the treatment is still within the holdover time; (b) shall stop the aircraft and set the parking brake at a position from which takeoff  can be accomplished within a reasonable amount of time after the completion of the pre-takeoff check; and (c) shall request a pre-takeoff contamination check from qualified ground personnel as described below, if: 1. the predetermined portions of the aircraft cannot be assured to be free of contamination; and 2. low visibility or insufficient lighting prevents such checks.

(K) Commander of the aeroplane shall be involved in the decision making process of whether or not to deice their aeroplane. Commander bases his decision on the initial inspection and recommendation of qualified ground crew. Where contamination is adhering to one or more critical surface, Commander shall have the aeroplane de-iced. Should Commander elect to verify whether or not contamination is adhering, a tactile check, under the supervision of Commander or delegate, shall be completed by a qualified ground crew member. This procedure should be sufficient to resolve any dispute regarding the adherence of contamination on the aeroplane. It is Commander\u2019s overriding responsibility to ensure that, at the commencement of take-off, no ice, slush, snow or frost is adhering to any critical surface of the aeroplane. Inspection by ground personnel does not relieve Commander of the responsibility for the pre-flight inspection. Commander maintains final authority in all required deicing/anti-icing situations. (L) Notwithstanding that authority, the following methods are applied: (1)  Where contamination is adhering to one or more critical surfaces, Commander shall have the aeroplane de-iced; (2) Commander\u2019s decision to order deicing and/or anti-icing cannot be overruled or reduced to a lower level of protection; and (3) Where a tactile inspection by the deicing representative does not resolve a disagreement regarding the adherence of contamination, Commander should take the most conservative course of action.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 354 | Total Page: 623 \n8.2.4.10 Ramp and Taxi Precautions (A) When off-gate de-icing/anti-icing area is entered by taxiing, a sufficient taxi and stopping guidance must be arranged, or marshaller assistance must be given.

In this case, after completing checks down to engine start, have the aeroplane pushed back, to a position from which it can taxi forward, before starting engines. Be aware that idle thrust may be sufficient to move the aeroplane forward even though the parking brake is set.  (C) Be alert to the possibility of engine inlet ice build-up during taxi and ground holding operations. Ice can form in engine inlets at temperatures above 10 \u00b0C with high humidity present during extensive ground holds with the engines at idle. If visible moisture is present with a temperature below that specified in the FCOM/AFM, engine anti-ice systems must be selected ON after each engine is started. Note: Ensure that probe/pitot and sensor heating systems are ON before taxiing. (D) Taxi with great care since rutted areas may cause steering problems. Neither aircraft nor ground vehicles are capable of stopping quickly. When guide lamp installations are available, make use of them to align the aircraft in the gate area. Snow may cover the normal taxi markings. Be alert to the possibility of foreign object damage due to high snow in ramp areas or along narrow taxiways. Test braking and steering capabilities frequently. Maintain a greater distance than normal from other traffic to avoid jet-blast which could adversely affect anti-ice treatment and/or blow contaminants onto the aeroplane. (E) Engine thrust may need to be higher than normal to overcome the drag caused by slush or snow. Changes should be made slowly and carefully to avoid blowing equipment and/or contaminants into other aircraft.

Apply thrust slowly to prevent asymmetry which would also affect directional control. (D) During takeoff roll maintain positive forward pressure on the nose wheel and use rudder for directional control as soon as it becomes effective. 8.2.4.11.1 Rotation Technique (A) During takeoff in poor weather conditions or in a contaminated runway situation, takeoff roll and rotation shall be equal to a normal takeoff situation, holding light forward pressure and using rudder and aileron to maintain directional control. Target pitch attitude shall be attained using normal rotation rate of 2-3 degrees/sec. This will ensure that any abnormal pitch-up tendency due to possible residual contamination over the airfoil is detected early and the angle of attack does not become higher than normal.

AFM calculations for the respective type shall also be considered. The limiting  calculation shall be the governing one for the operational use.  (B) For any flight, scheduled or diverted to Canada, the Commander of the flight shall consider that there is a different standardized method of determining what the effect of braking is for a given certain type of runway contamination, which is called Canadian Runway Friction Index (CRFI). Description of CRFI and Method of Measurement (A) The decelerometer is an instrument mounted in a test vehicle that measures the decelerating forces acting on the vehicle when the brakes are applied. The instrument is graduated in increments from 0 to 1, the highest number being equivalent to the theoretical maximum decelerating capability of the vehicle on a dry surface. These numbers are referred to as the CRFI. It is evident that small numbers represent low braking coefficients of friction while numbers on the order of 0.8 and above indicate the braking coefficients to be expected on bare and dry runways. (B) The brakes are applied on the test vehicle at 300m (1000ft) intervals along the RWY within a distance of 10m (30ft) from each side of the RWY centerline at that distance from the centerline where the majority of ACFT operations take place at each given site. The readings taken are averaged and reported as the CRFI number. Aircraft Movement Surface Condition Reports (AMSCR) (A) AMSCRs are issued to alert pilots of natural surface contaminants\u2014such as snow, ice or slush\u2014that could affect ACFT braking performance. The Runway Surface Condition (RSC) section of the report provides information about RWY condition in plain language, while the CRFI section describes braking action quantitatively using the numerical format. (B) Because of mechanical and operational limitations, the RWY friction readings produced by decelerometer devices may be inaccurate under certain surface conditions. As a result, RWY friction readings will not be taken and a CRFI will not be provided to ATS or to pilots when any of the following conditions are present: (1)  the RWY surface is wet and no other type of contamination is present; (2)  there is a layer of slush on the RWY surface and no other type of contamination is present;", "doc_id": "ffc6cc7d-42bd-44a0-9bd3-896c6186ebbe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "83b254678bcb0a01672ff546c54f2ed370b9e57264999b2c82a3e10c03d8e707", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 389166, "end": 392786}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "0886b044-dee8-477c-b941-3b3083423c44", "3": "d19f5622-5dca-4c92-87e9-7d054cf1622f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d19f5622-5dca-4c92-87e9-7d054cf1622f": {"__data__": {"text": "the RWY friction readings produced by decelerometer devices may be inaccurate under certain surface conditions.

A NOTAM may also be cancelled if the reporting requirements are no longer met or the NOTAM was issued in error.

(H) Information on taxiways and aprons, although not mandatory, can be disseminated in a NOTAM if deemed to have an impact on safe operations. CRFI Application to Aircraft Performance  (A) The information contained in Tables 1 and 2 below has been compiled and is considered to be the best data available at this time, because it is based upon extensive field test performance data of ACFT braking on winter-contaminated surfaces. It should provide a useful guide to pilots when estimating ACFT performance under adverse RWY conditions. The onus for the production of information, guidance or advice on the operation of ACFT on a wet and/or contaminated RWY rests with the ACFT manufacturer. The information published in Tables 1 and 2 below does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit deviations from regulatory requirements. These tables are intended to be used at the pilot's discretion. (B) Because of the many variables associated with computing accelerate-stop distances and balanced field lengths, it has not been possible to reduce the available data to the point where CRFI corrections can be provided, which would be applicable to all types of operations. Consequently, only corrections for landing distances and", "doc_id": "9e915f9f-f8b4-4dad-a81c-daefd7fa0267", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5c73bdf85f365e1028bcb9682c148818d95fd1ce0ef73e056ca002dca59978a7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 395944, "end": 399352}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "d19f5622-5dca-4c92-87e9-7d054cf1622f", "3": "36edf4d1-74bd-4891-9e69-32c83238ecb1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "36edf4d1-74bd-4891-9e69-32c83238ecb1": {"__data__": {"text": "additional, authorize changes in, or permit deviations from regulatory requirements.

(B) Because of the many variables associated with computing accelerate-stop distances and balanced field lengths, it has not been possible to reduce the available data to the point where CRFI corrections can be provided, which would be applicable to all types of operations. Consequently, only corrections for landing distances and crosswinds are included pending further study of the take-off problem. (C) It should be noted that in all cases the tables are based on corrections to ACFT Flight Manual (AFM) dry RWY data and that the certification criteria does not allow consideration of the extra decelerating forces provided by reverse thrust or propeller reversing. On dry RWYs, thrust reversers provide only a small portion of the total decelerating forces when compared to wheel braking. However, as wheel braking becomes less effective, the portion of the stopping distance attributable to thrust reversing becomes greater. For this reason, if reversing is employed when a low CRFI is reported, a \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 360 | Total Page: 623 \ncomparison of the actual stopping distance with that shown in Table 1 will make the estimates appear overly conservative. Nevertheless, there are circumstances, such as crosswind conditions, engine out situations or reverser malfunctions, that may preclude their use. (D) Landing distances recommended in Table 1 are intended to be used for aeroplanes with no discing and/or reverse thrust capability and are based on statistical variation measured during actual flight tests. (E) Notwithstanding the above comments on the use of discing and/or reverse thrust, Table 2 may be used for aeroplanes with discing and/or reverse thrust capability and is based on the landing distances recommended in Table 1 with additional calculations that give credit for discing and/or reverse thrust. In calculating the distances in Table 2, the air distance from the screen height of 50ft to touchdown and the delay distance from touchdown to the application of full braking remain unchanged from Table 1. The effects of discing and/or reverse thrust were used only to reduce the stopping distance from the application of full braking to a complete stop. (F) The recommended landing distances stated in Table 2 take into account the reduction in landing distances obtained with the use of discing and/or reverse thrust capability for a turboprop powered aeroplane and with the use of reverse thrust for a turbojet-powered aeroplane. Representative low values of discing and/or reverse thrust effect have been assumed and, therefore, the data may be conservative for properly executed landings by some aeroplanes with highly effective discing and/or thrust reversing systems. (G) The crosswind limits for CRFI shown in Table 3 contain a slightly different display range of RWY friction index values from those listed in Tables 1 and 2. However, the CRFI values used for Table 3 are exactly the same as those used for Tables 1 and 2 and are appropriate for the index value increments indicated. \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 361 | Total Page: 623 \nTable 1 - CRFI Recommended Landing Distances (No Discing/Reverse Thrust) LDG DIST (m) Bare and Dry Unfactored Reported Canadian Runway Friction Index (CRFI)  Landing Field Length (m) Bare and Dry 0.60  0.55  0.50", "doc_id": "36edf4d1-74bd-4891-9e69-32c83238ecb1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "613dd38d31a07acc854ccb0bacd8e0cf08da293d813842da762c195906d5f3fc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 399266, "end": 402980}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "9e915f9f-f8b4-4dad-a81c-daefd7fa0267", "3": "5e7fc255-27c6-47fd-b948-0a26fb80e993"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e7fc255-27c6-47fd-b948-0a26fb80e993": {"__data__": {"text": "-A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 361 | Total Page: 623 \nTable 1 - CRFI Recommended Landing Distances (No Discing/Reverse Thrust) LDG DIST (m) Bare and Dry Unfactored Reported Canadian Runway Friction Index (CRFI)  Landing Field Length (m) Bare and Dry 0.60  0.55  0.50  0.45  0.40  0.35  0.30  0.27  0.25  0.22  0.20  0.18  Recommended Landing Distance in Meters  \n(No Discing/Reverse Thrust)   Factor  60%  70%  549 951 976 1006  1040  1079  1128  1189  1232  1265  1320  1363  1409  915 784 610 1061  1092  1125  1168  1214  1272  1345  1393  1433  1497  1546  1601  1016  871 671 1134  1168  1208  1253  1305  1372  1448  1506  1549  1619  1674  1738  1118  958 732 1250  1290  1332  1384  1445  1518  1604  1668  1713  1793  1854  1921  1220  1046  793 1357  1400  1448  1506  1573  1653  1750  1817  1869  1954  2021  2094  1321  1133  854 1451  1497  1552  1613  1686  1771  1875  1948  2003  2098  2168  2244  1423  1220  915 1546  1598  1656  1723  1802  1896  2009  2091  2152  2253  2329  2415  1525  1307  976 1662  1717  1781  1857  1942  2049  2174  2262  2329  2442  2527  2622  1626  1394  1037  1750  1811  1881  1960  2055  2168  2302  2399  2469  2591  2683  2783  1728  1481  1098  1845  1909  1982  2067  2171  2290  2436  2539  2616  2744  2841  2951  1829  1568  1159  1933  2003  2082  2174  2280  2408  2564  2674  2756  2893  3000  3116  1931  1655  1220  1997  2067  2149  2247  2357  2491  2652  2768  2853  2997  3103  3225  2033  1742  Example:  A330 landing at CYVR, APT ELEV 14ft, RWY 08R, ZERO WIND, CRFI 0.30, Landing weight 160T  Landing Distance for Bare and Dry (Unfactored)  1005m (AFM)  Recommended Landing Distance  2237m  1.

Once in flight, equipment which are not directly required for navigation along the selected route should be tuned to ground stations within range of which indications will enable the accuracy of the primary aids to be verified, or from which the bearing and distance indications will enable ground-speed checks or ETA adjustments to be made. The routine use of all fitted equipment will ensure that errors in performance or faulty operation may be detected, and rectification arranged at an early stage. (D) Reliance should not be placed on information derived from ground beacons until the appropriate coded signal has been identified and, in the case of two-pilot flight crew, confirmed by both pilots. One flight crew should read aloud the coordinates, tracks or distances while the other flight crew operates the keyboard and reads back the figures he has programmed as a cross-check of their accuracy. In flight, other available navigation equipment should be selected and used to confirm the accuracy of the primary aid, and to be readily available for use if the primary equipment gives indications of inaccuracy or malfunction. Above all, flight crew members must remain alert to the possibility of errors in programming or performance, and be prepared to revert to the use of raw data provided by such standard VOR, NDB and DME equipment as are available. (E) Navigation logs should be comprehensively completed en route, except when climbing and descending, and ETAs should be kept amended to take account of significant changes. Note should be made of any diversion from the planned route, whether initiated by the Commander or requested by air traffic control, with a brief description of the circumstances, the time the alteration was made, and any fuel replanning calculations which were necessary. If difficulties are encountered in following a particular route, the more information which is recorded to assist a post-flight investigation, the greater will be the chances of overcoming the problems on future flights over the same route. It must be noted that when operating off the route indicated on the navigation log the listed safety altitudes may not be valid and caution must be exercised especially during climb out and at top of descent. (F)  Phases of flight requiring compulsory use of the systems are specified in Subchapter 8.3.18 (e.g. autopilot, flight director, etc.). 8.3.2.1.1 Procedures for System Degradation (A) Degradation of on-board equipment must be taken into consideration for any in-flight planning/replanning with regard to destination and alternate weather, and for fuel planning for en-route conditions.  (B) Any downgrading of ground facilities must be assessed with regard to possible increased landing minima at destination and/or alternate airports.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 368 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.2.1.2 Navigation (A) The most important principle governing the performance of all navigation tasks is redundancy, as navigational errors carry a significant risk potential.  (B) Whether navigating on manually-tuned navigation aids, on the navigation system or on radar vectors, cross-checks of the primary aids are essential.

The sole use of the airborne navigation systems carried on the aeroplane is not adequate for all phases of flight and should be supplemented by specific independent checks using those equipment not directly required for navigation.  (C) Flight plans activated in the navigation system shall be checked by both pilots against the flight plan by comparing the routing (airways) and total distance to be flown. For flights utilizing ETOPS and/or MNPS (HLA) airspace, FMS shall be checked by both pilots by comparing the waypoints, tracks and distances of such special procedure airspace segments against the flight plan. A FMS is also suitable and authorized for preflight planning (when an Operational Flight Plan is not available). (D) For in-flight replanning, all available means (e.g. Route Facility Charts) shall be used to cross-check the corresponding data.  (E) For adhoc in-flight replanning, flight crews must not only check if the fuel requirements of Subchapter 8.1.7 will be met, but also if the available navigational aids for the replanned route and/or the replanned destination as well as the airborne equipment will be sufficient and satisfactory for a safe conclusion of the flight. 8.3.2.1.3 Navigation Procedures (A) Notwithstanding the overall responsibility of the Commander for precise navigation and proper use and handling of navigation systems, the Pilot Flying (PF) is responsible for the selection of the navigation aids and of the required navigation system configuration. (B) It is the responsibility of all flight crew members to monitor navigation performance, verify present position and, if applicable, maintain a particular RNP, in accordance with the respective AFM\u2019s. (C) The PF, whenever flying manually, will direct the PM to set specific navaids. In such cases, the PM is responsible to set, identify and check the navaids specified by the PF and to establish the required navigation system configuration.  (D) When flying on autopilot, the PF sets and identifies the navaids and checks the navigation system configuration. Any changes made by PM shall be made at request of, and be checked by the PF.  (E) The flight crews shall inform each other of any doubts about the reliability of a navigation aid or of a system.  (F) For flights or portions of a flight conducted at altitudes where safe terrain clearance is not contingent upon navigation accuracy, the on-board navigation system redundancy may be considered acceptable as long as the aeroplane's computed positions are checked at regular intervals against displayed navigation aids, where these aids are available. In areas where such aids are not available (e.g. sea, desert), traffic separation provided by ATC accounts for the reduced navigation accuracy.  (G) Safe terrain clearance is dependent on navigation accuracy for take-off and climb. If the departure procedures are stored in the navigation database, the on-board navigation system must be in the update mode and the system-computed positions checked continuously against displayed navigation aids. If these conditions cannot be met, take-off and climb must be performed according to conventional radio-navigation. \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 369 | Total Page: 623 \n(H) If the arrival procedures for descent and approach are stored in the navigation database the on-board navigation system must be in the update mode and the system-computed positions must be checked continuously against displayed navigation aids.

The use is restricted down to MOCA/MORA/MSA and intermediate approach altitude, unless the system is certified for use in the approach according to the AOM.  (I) If these conditions are not met, the whole descent and/or approach procedure must be performed by using conventional radio-navigation. (J) ILS facilities of all categories are known to produce false beams outside their coverage sectors due to radiation aberrations. Such beams are subject to being captured without a warning flag. In order to ensure proper localizer beam capture, the ILS mode shall not be armed until the vicinity of the beam has been ascertained and checked by independent navigation aids and the capture shall be monitored by the same means.  (K) During IMC conditions, a DME distance/altitude check at glide slope/glide path intercept or at the OM position or its equivalent by comparison to the Instrument Approach Chart shall be performed whenever possible to avoid false glide slope/glide path captures and unstabilized approaches.  (L) FMS vertical navigation features may not substitute for altitude preselect procedures and practices.  8.3.2.1.4 Navigation Aids (A) Navigation aids should be selected for coverage and geometry with adequate cross-checks. Distance information for cross-checks shall be used only if a DME is co-located with a VOR which coincides with a waypoint.  (B) If not otherwise specified for certain procedures, required navigation aids must be positively identified at the time of selection. VOR or ILS associated DMEs require separate identification.  (C) Whenever elements of information relative to position are contradictory, the reliability of any relevant navigation aid(s) should be verified by additional independent means.  (D) Navigation and approach aids must not be used:  (1) Whenever positive identification is not possible. (2) Whenever reports or other information (e.g. NOTAMS) indicate that system is unserviceable, unreliable, ground checked only, or on test. 8.3.2.1.5 FMS Navigation (A) Standard en-route navigation shall be performed by FMS navigation where appropriate tracking is either pre-programmed in the navigation database or manually set up by using waypoints/airways contained in the pre-programmed database.

(C) PBN may be required on notified routes, for notified procedures and in notified airspace. (D) For purposes of consistency with the PBN concept, this chapter is using the designation \u2018RNAV 10\u2019 because this specification does not include on-board performance monitoring and alerting. However, many routes still use the designation \u2018RNP 10\u2019 instead of \u2018RNAV 10\u2019. \u2018RNP 10\u2019 was used as designation before the publication of the fourth edition of ICAO Doc 9613 in 2013. The terms \u2018RNP 10\u2019 and \u2018RNAV 10\u2019 shall be considered equivalent. (E) All Turkish Airlines airplanes are GNSS equipped. All oceanic/remote phases of flight requiring RNAV 10 or RNP 4 shall be flown with GNSS update.

While similar in functional requirements, differences exist between these two documents. ICAO PBN specification harmonized European and United States RNAV criteria into a single ICAO RNAV 1 and 2 specification. The aeroplane requirements for RNAV 1 and 2 are identical, while some operating procedures are different. (H) The flight crew shall ensure that RNAV 1, RNAV 2, RNP 1, RNP 2, and RNP APCH routes or procedures to be used for the intended flight, including for any alternate aerodromes, are selectable from the navigation database and are not prohibited by NOTAM. The flight crew shall take account of any NOTAMs or briefing material that could adversely affect the aircraft system operation along its flight plan including any alternate aerodromes. (I)    When PBN relies on GNSS systems for which RAIM is required for integrity, its availability shall be verified during the preflight planning (RAIM Prediction) through NOTAMs.  In the event of a predicted continuous loss of fault detection of more than five minutes, the flight planning shall be revised to reflect the lack of full PBN capability for that period.

Database cycles have one day in common. If within the UTC date and time at common day, flight crew shall select and activate the new database cycle prior first flight of the day. (2)    The active flight plan, if applicable, shall be checked by comparing the charts or other applicable documents with navigation equipment and displays. This includes confirmation of the departing runway and the waypoint sequence, reasonableness of track angles and distances (For SIDs/STARs differences of 3 degrees or less may result from the equipment manufacturer\u2019s application of magnetic variation and are operationally acceptable),  any altitude or speed constraints, and, where possible, which waypoints are fly-by and which are fly-over.

(5)    An arrival, approach or departure procedure shall not be used if the validity of the procedure in the navigation database has expired. Navigation databases shall be current for the duration of the flight. If the AIRAC cycle will change during flight, apply the following procedures to ensure the accuracy of navigation data, including suitability of navigation facilities used to define the routes and procedures for flight: (a)    electronic data must be verified against paper products. Flight crew must compare aeronautical charts (new and old) to verify navigation fixes, (b)    if an amended chart is published for the procedure, the database must not be used to conduct the operation, (c)    an alternative planning shall be requested in coordination with dispatch, excluding affected procedures and navigation facilities and/or waypoints.

If the navigation system does not extract and set the navigation accuracy from the on-board navigation database for each segment of the procedure, then the flight crew shall ensure that the smallest navigation accuracy required to complete the approach or the missed approach is selected before initiating the approach (e.g. before the IAF). Different IAFs may have different navigation accuracy, which are annotated on the approach chart. (4)  The flight crew shall ensure that no loss of RNP annunciation is received prior to commencing the RNP AR APCH. During the approach, if at any time a loss of RNP annunciation is received, the flight crew shall abandon the RNP AR APCH unless the pilot has in sight the visual references required to continue the approach.

If the equipment is not adequate for the RNP AR APCH, discontinue planning and switch to conventional procedures or divert. (b)  Ability to revert conventional procedures during go-around, in case of loss of capability to sustain required navigation performance must be briefed before the approach.

(B) At intervals of approximately 1 hour, cross-checks between the primary altimeters shall be made. A minimum of two will need to agree within \u00b160 m (\u00b1200 ft). (C) The usual scan of flight deck instruments should suffice for altimeter cross-checking on most flights. (D) If the pilot is notified by ATC of a deviation from an assigned altitude (AAD) exceeding \u00b190 m (\u00b1300 ft) then the pilot shall take action to return to cleared flight level as quickly as possible. (E) For in-flight procedures including procedures prior to RVSM entry, equipment required, contingency procedures, refer to the applicable FCOM and EK.10.73.002 Operations Manual Part-C / Jeppesen Airway Manual. (F) For RVSM phraseologies, refer to EK.10.73.002 Operations Manual Part-C / Jeppesen Airway Manual . 8.3.2.2.5.5 Contingency Procedures After Entering RVSM Airspace (A) The pilot should notify ATC of contingencies (equipment failures, weather) that affect the ability to maintain the cleared flight level and coordinate a plan of action appropriate to the airspace concerned. The pilot should obtain to the guidance on contingency procedures is contained in the relevant publications dealing with the airspace. (B) Examples of equipment failures that should be notified to ATC are: (1) failure of all automatic altitude-control systems aboard the aircraft; (2) loss of redundancy of altimetry systems; (3) loss of thrust on an engine necessitating descent; or (4) any other equipment failure affecting the ability to maintain cleared flight level. (C) The pilot should notify ATC when encountering greater than moderate turbulence. (D) If unable to notify ATC and obtain an ATC clearance prior to deviating from the cleared flight level, the pilot should follow any established contingency procedures for the region of operation and obtain ATC clearance as soon as possible.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 387 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.2.2.5.6  Post Flight Procedures (A) When height-keeping errors specified below are encountered or received (from ATC), it shall be recorded to AML", "doc_id": "f2fd6ff1-d940-400d-9858-107745e4fcc1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "dfd69d91a8b0ddc4762e43833037e845e4a6b6e93214e5638fef4e6999d3b016", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 484339, "end": 487742}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "85b6f936-b706-4317-b0ac-25fb8bfa478b", "3": "09ed4ba2-e50f-4b7a-bb7c-5f312552d247"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "09ed4ba2-e50f-4b7a-bb7c-5f312552d247": {"__data__": {"text": "soon as possible.   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 387 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.2.2.5.6  Post Flight Procedures (A) When height-keeping errors specified below are encountered or received (from ATC), it shall be recorded to AML for immediate action to be taken to rectify the conditions that caused the errors and provide follow-up report via SRS, to be provided if requested by the authority: (1) a total vertical error (TVE) of \u00b1 90 m (\u00b1 300 ft) (note 1); (2) an altimetry system error (ASE) of \u00b1 75 m (\u00b1 245 ft) (note 1); and (3) an assigned altitude deviation (AAD) of \u00b1 90 m (\u00b1 300 ft).

(B) It is the Commander\u2019s responsibility to ensure that correct taxi route is followed and the correct runway is used for take-off and landing in response to an aural callout or a visual alert provided by RAAS. (C) Flight crew must be aware that RAAS callouts and alerts are not intended for navigation purposes and does not include knowledge of NOTAM or ATIS. (D) RAAS annunciations do not ensure that a runway can, or cannot, be safely used for takeoff or landing. (E) Refer to FCOM for further details. 8.3.5.2 Avoiding Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT) (A) Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) occurs when an airworthy aeroplane under the complete control of the flight crew is inadvertently flown into terrain, water, or an obstacle. (B) During the final approach segment, attention by PF and PM shall be given to required altitude constraint or altitude/distance checks prior to reaching the MDA(H) or DA(H). (C) To enhance the flight crew\u2019s terrain awareness, an appropriate callout shall be made by flight crew when the radio altimeter activates at 2,500 ft height AGL. (D) The radio altimeter reading shall then be included in the instrument scan for the remainder of the approach. (E) Radio altimeter readings below the minimum obstacle clearance (MOC) values should alert the flight crew (e.g., 1,000 ft, 500 ft, etc.). (F) Flight crew shall be ready to respond/maneuver, as appropriate, to any unanticipated radio altimeter callout or to successive radio altimeter callouts that are not consistent with the aeroplane rate of descent and/or position.  \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 396 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.6 Policy and Procedures for the", "doc_id": "c4ae40b6-180e-4b34-9dfa-6ee0a6098442", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5862a169f71fa20350b6a3fab804ebda9ff5edcae3005ae1c84f382b5b2646ef", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 508321, "end": 511546}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "e50f13eb-5894-4f7c-92d4-8112837817c3", "3": "3eab5754-12a4-417b-875c-1d6a71f25891"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eab5754-12a4-417b-875c-1d6a71f25891": {"__data__": {"text": "appropriate, to any unanticipated radio altimeter callout or to successive radio altimeter callouts that are not consistent with the aeroplane rate of descent and/or position.  \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 396 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.6 Policy and Procedures for the Use of ACAS / TCAS (A) ACAS / TCAS shall be used during flight, except as provided in the minimum equipment list (MEL). It shall be used in TA/RA mode, unless inhibition of RA indication mode (using TA indication only) is called for by an abnormal procedure or due to performance limiting conditions. (B) The flight crew has to maintain a constant lookout and avoid other traffic during all phases of flight. Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) / Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) display and ATC radar service is helpful in detecting other traffic. (C) Within an airspace deemed critical by the flight crew, any activity diverting attention (e.g. paper work, FMS insertions) must be reduced to a minimum for monitoring other traffic. Particularly critical areas are the vicinity of aerodromes, high intensity terminal areas and flight below 10.000 ft. (D) In general the rate of climb/descend should not exceed 1000 ft/min within the last 1000 ft before reaching the assigned level, in order to reduce the risk of TCAS Resolution Advisories (RAs). Special country rules and regulations shall be respected. (E) Nevertheless rate of climb/descend instructions given by ATC for the purpose of maintaining separation of traffic shall be strictly complied with. (F) It is the direct responsibility of the Commander to avoid collision. 8.3.6.1 Callouts Callouts that shall be made by the PM (1)  \u201c2,000 TO GO\u201d or \u201c2,000 FEET TO LEVEL OFF\u201d when within 2,000 ft of the assigned/cleared altitude/FL.

(B) The following phraseology shall be used to notify ATC: (1) After a flight crew starts to deviate from any ATC clearance or instruction in order to comply with a TCAS RA:  (a) Pilot: \u201cTURKISH 123 TCAS RA\u201d (TEE-CAS-AR-AY) (2) In the event that a flight crew receives an ATC clearance or instruction which is contradictory to the TCAS RA, controllers should expect the flight crew to follow the RA and ATC shall be informed directly by responding:  (a) Pilot: \u201cTURKISH 123 UNABLE, TCAS RA\u201d (3) The ATC response in both cases should be \u201cROGER\u201d. This relieves the controller of the responsibility to provide separation and he should stop issuing further instructions until the pilot reports the conflict has been cleared. (4) After a flight crew response to a TCAS RA is completed, and a return to the ATC clearance or instruction is initiated, or has already been resumed:  (a) Pilot: \u201cTURKISH 123 CLEAR OF CONFLICT, (assigned clearance) RESUMED\u201d or, (b) Pilot: \u201cTURKISH 123 CLEAR OF CONFLICT, RETURNING TO (assigned clearance)\u201d  (C) Whenever an aeroplane has to be maneuvered  in compliance with a RA, both pilots shall fill out an Air Safety Report (refer to Chapter 11).   \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 398 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.7 Policy and Procedures for In-Flight Fuel Management 8.3.7.1 In-Flight Fuel Checks (A) The Commander shall ensure that fuel checks are carried out in-flight at intervals not exceeding 30 minutes.

On a flight of less than one hour an intermediate check is to be made at a convenient time when the flight deck workload permits. At each check the usable remaining fuel shall be recorded on the operational flight plan (OFP) and evaluated to: (1) compare actual consumption with planned consumption; (2) check that the usable fuel remaining is sufficient to complete the flight in accordance with in-flight fuel management requirements; and (3) determine the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome. (B) The relevant fuel data shall be recorded. (C) In case Electronic Flight Folder (EFF) module of the installed EFB is operational and capable of recording fuel checks either automatically or manually, recording of this data on the OFP is not required. For EFB installed aircraft, the fuel check is automatically recorded by EFB software over each waypoint. However, if fuel check is not recorded due to system malfunction, Commander shall ensure that manual entry of fuel quantity check on the to EFB Route Leg is completed within a period of not exceeding 30 minutes. 8.3.7.2 In-Flight Fuel Management (A) The Commander shall ensure that the flight will be conducted so that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is not less than: (1) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel; or (2) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required. (B) If an in-flight fuel check shows that the expected usable fuel remaining on arrival at the destination aerodrome is less than: (1) the required alternate fuel plus final reserve fuel: the Commander shall take into account the traffic and the operational conditions prevailing at the destination aerodrome, and at any other adequate aerodrome in deciding whether to proceed to the destination aerodrome (refer to Subchapter 8.3.7.4 for Commitment to Stay) or to divert so as to perform a safe landing with not less than final reserve fuel; or (2) the final reserve fuel if no alternate aerodrome is required: the Commander shall take appropriate action and proceed to an adequate aerodrome so as to perform a safe landing with not less than final reserve fuel.

(F) The fuel situation must be continually monitored by the flight crew. Changes in the operational status of the destination aerodrome and of the alternate aerodromes and deviations from the original flight plan (e.g. re-routing by ATC) must be taken into account. (G) When in-flight replanning is performed the operational flight plan must be amended accordingly.  8.3.7.3 Additional Conditions for Specific Procedures (A) On a flight using Reduced Contingency Fuel (RCF) Procedure, to proceed to the destination aerodrome (destination 1 aerodrome), the Commander shall ensure that the usable fuel remaining at the decision point is at least the total of: (1) trip fuel from the decision point to the destination aerodrome;  (2) contingency fuel equal to 5 % of trip fuel from the decision point to the destination aerodrome;  (3) destination aerodrome alternate fuel, if a destination alternate aerodrome is required; and  (4) final reserve fuel. (B) On a flight using Predetermined Point (PDP) Procedure, to proceed to the destination aerodrome, the Commander shall ensure that the usable fuel remaining at the PDP is at least the total of:  (1) trip fuel from the PDP to the destination aerodrome;  (2) contingency fuel from the PDP to the destination aerodrome; and  (3) additional fuel.  (C) On a flight using Isolated Aerodrome Procedure, the last possible point of diversion to any available en-route alternate (ERA) aerodrome shall be used as the PDP and the fuel remaining at this point shall be evaluated as decribed above in item (B). Before reaching this point, the Commander shall assess the fuel usable expected to remain overhead the isolated aerodrome, the weather conditions, and the traffic and operational conditions prevailing at the isolated aerodrome and at any of the en-route aerodrome before deciding whether to proceed to the isolated aerodrome or to divert to an en-route aerodrome.

In this case, when the requested deviation is approved, the pilot is expected to provide his own navigation, maintain the altitude assigned by ATC and to remain within the specified mileage of his original course. (2) If possible, plan deviations on the upwind side of storm cells to avoid turbulent down-flow air. Never deviate under a storm cell or the associated anvil. (3)  Request a new route to avoid the affected area. (4)   Request a change of altitude. (5)   Request radar vectors around the affected areas. (6)   The controller must be informed as soon as possible when clear of weather and returning to flight plan route.  (H) For safety reasons, a flight crew operating under IFR shall normally not deviate for meteorological conditions from an assigned course or altitude or flight level without a proper ATC clearance. When weather conditions encountered are so severe that an immediate deviation is necessary and time will not permit approval by ATC, the Commander\u2019s emergency authority may be exercised.

(B) Severe icing is often associated with supercooled large droplets (i.e. freezing drizzle or rain). Flight in these conditions is not covered by icing certification rules. Droplets covered by icing certification envelopes are so small that they are usually below the threshold of detectability. Note: Consult the AFM/FCOMs for specific information regarding handling techniques if inadvertently encountering severe icing conditions. (C) The most effective means of identifying severe icing conditions are cues that can be seen, felt or heard. This includes visual inspection of aeroplane surfaces, e.g. wings or windscreen. At temperatures near freezing it may be possible to detect large droplets splashing or splattering upon impact with the windscreen.  8.3.8.5 Turbulence (A) Turbulence is defined as a disturbed, irregular flow of air with embedded irregular whirls or eddies and waves. An aeroplane in turbulent flow is subjected to irregular and random motions while, more or less, maintainin its intended flight path.

(K) For more information on windshear, refer to Operations Manual Part-B and EK.10.73.002 Operations Manual Part-C / Jeppesen AirwayManual. 8.3.8.7 Jetstream (A) Jetstream is a high speed, meandering wind current, generally moving from a westerly direction at speeds of 80kt or more (up to 300kt) concentrated within a narrow band embedded in the troposphere. (B) The extent in length is up to several thousand miles, the width can be several miles. (C) In mid-latitudes there is a common area for clear air turbulence (CAT) around the jet stream. Taking a cross section of a jet stream looking downwind, the turbulent region would be to the left of the jet core in Northern Hemisphere and to the right in Southern Hemisphere. (D) To avoid or to leave the areas of CAT the following procedures should be applied: (1) When flying parallel with the Jetstream, changing altitude up to 1000 ft. (2) When flying perpendicular to the Jetstream, changing altitude by 1000 ft. - from the warm to the cold side downwards, from the cold to the warm side upwards. (3) If the temperature is changing in the CAT area the flight should be continued on course; probably the CAT area will be crossed in a short time.

The greatest hazards to flight are reduced visibility and risk of icing in combination with low temperature. (B) On the ground, contaminated runways may influence the performance, crosswind limitations and give a risk of aquaplaning. The special procedures on the FCOM/FCTM of the respective aeroplane shall be followed. (C) Partial loss of orientation may occur after changeover from instruments to visual flying during the approach, especially in snow showers and blowing snow. (D) In falling or blowing snow, landing lights should be used with caution as the reflected light may actually reduce the effective visibility and even cause false impression of drift during flare and roll-out.

The strong vertical and horizontal wind shears, so called rotor turbulences, represent a danger at low heights as well as the strong downslope wind at the lee side of the mountains. (B) Frequently, a second rotor will form up to 100 NM from the lee side of the mountain, producing original wave action. Flight crews should be aware of the potential hazard at airports within the flow regime of the wave. (C) When approaching a mountain range from the upwind side, there will usually be a smooth updraft. Therefore, it is not quite as dangerous an area as the lee of the range. From the leeward side, it is always a good idea to add an extra thousand feet or so of altitude because downdrafts can exceed the climb capability of the aircraft. Never expect an updraft when approaching a mountain chain from the leeward. Flight crew should always be prepared to cope with a downdraft and turbulence.

(B) In inversions windshear may be encountered. (C) Temperature inversions usually affect aeroplane performance adversely.  (D) A significant temperature inversion after takeoff, during climb out causes a sudden speed loss and decreased aeroplane performance due to higher temperature. (E) If there is a temperature inversion in the upper levels, the maximum cruising altitude capability of the aeroplane may be significantly reduced. (F) Strong inversions in pre-cold-front situations may be associated with strong low altitude jet winds immediately above the ground. The main negative performance factor is caused by the decrease in engine power resulting from the temperature rise. In case of known or forecast temperature inversion corrections to the performance limits must be applied as per the FCOM/FCTM. (G) Flight crew must be aware of sea breeze windshear especially on flights to islands in summer time where the runways are often close to the shore. Airfields near the coast will be more affected than those inland. 8.3.9 Wake Turbulence (A) Wake turbulences are generated by pressure exchanges between the lower and upper surfaces of the wing. Those exchanges cause counter rotating vortices at the outer wingtips (the heavier an aeroplane, the larger the vortices). Extreme caution is required in terminal areas, where aeroplanes are flown at low speeds with flaps extended, generating strong wake turbulences. (B) The vortices descend at a rate of 400-500 fpm down to 900 ft below the altitude of the generating aeroplane and settle at that altitude. If generated near the ground they descend to around 100 ft to 200 ft above ground and spread out at a speed of approximately 5 kt in still air. Vortex strength diminishes with time and distance behind the aeroplane. In calm wind conditions, the remaining vortices from a landing aeroplane may persist without noticeable weakening or dissipation for up to 5 minutes.

(C) A slight crosswind may keep the windward vortex on the runway for more than 2 minutes. The intensity of the vortices increases with the mass of the generating aeroplane, the wing loading and the configuration. (D) The three basic effects of wake turbulence on a following aeroplane are the imposed roll, loss of height or rate of climb, and possible structural stress. The greatest danger is the imposed roll on the penetrating aeroplane to a degree exceeding its counter-control capability. Should the vortex encounter occur in the final approach area, its impact is heightened because the following aeroplane is in a critical state with regard to speed, thrust, altitude and reaction time. (E) In order to avoid possible wake turbulence, the wake turbulence separation minimas on Subchapter 8.3.9.1 should be followed.

(B) Wake turbulence separation minima are divided into four categories according to the maximum certificated takeoff mass: Wake Turbulence Categories (WTC)  Definition  J SUPER  A380 -800 H HEAVY  ACFT types of 136000KG (300000LBS) or more  M MEDIUM  ACFT types less than 136000kg (300000LBS) and more than 7000KG (15500LBS)  L LIGHT  ACFT types of 7000KG (15500LBS) or less  (C) Some MEDIUM types - such as the B757, creating vortices as strong as heavy aeroplanes - should be considered as HEAVY aeroplanes regarding wake turbulence generation.  (D) Non-radar separation for take-off, following minimums should be applied: Leading aeroplane  Following aeroplane  Seperation  J H 2 minutes  M 3 minutes (4 minutes, see Note ) H H N/A M 2 minutes (3 minutes, see Note ) M H N/A   M N/A N/A: Not applicable- no separation is necessary.

(F) Apart from the above standards for vortex separation, the controller or Commander may arrange for a larger separation in calm conditions or for other terrestrial factors which might enforce/retain the vortex energy for a longer time. On the other hand separation may be reduced in strong crosswind conditions when operating into/from single runway environments. (G) At some airports, Time Base Seperation (TBS) is used as primary method of aeroplane separation during strong headwinds (such as EGLL). When in stronger headwind conditions, a moderate reduction in separation distances from lead and follower aeroplane may be observed in comparison to distance based wake turbulence minima.    \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 412 | Total Page: 623 \n(H) Eurocontrol has developed a re-categorisation of ICAO wake turbulence longitudinal separation minima on approach and departure, called RECAT-EU.

This generally will be easily detectable and will be a prolonged condition. Some examples of obvious incapacitation are: heart disorders, severe brain disorders, severe internal bleeding, total collapse due to an acute infection, thrombosis, epilepsy etc. (B) Subtle incapacitation; this may be considered a more significant operational hazard, because it is difficult to detect and the effects can range from partial loss of functions to complete unconsciousness. Some examples of subtle incapacitation are: minor brain seizures, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), other medical disorders or preoccupation with personal problems, body pains such as toothache, headache, gastroenteritis, the delayed effects of alcohol, drugs or medication, common disorders such as a cold, etc.    \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 424 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.14.2 Recognition Of Incapacity (A) The key to early recognition of pilot incapacitation is the regular use of crew resource management concepts during flight crew compartment operation. Proper crew coordination involves checks and crosschecks using verbal communications. Routine adherence to standard operating procedures and standard profiles can aid in detecting a problem. (B) Flight Crew Recognition: If - for instance - the PM reports significant deviation from the intended flight path, it is essential, that the PF not only corrects this problem but also confirms this verbally. If a crew member doesn't respond to any question, call-out or checklist item in the normal way or does not adhere the standard operating procedures without notifying the other crew member, there is reason to believe that might be the beginning of a subtle incapacitation.  (C) Cabin Crew Recognition: The cabin crew member does not respond to verbal communications or significantly deviates from carrying out the tasks delegated to him. (D) Other common symptoms of the beginning of an incapacitation are: (1) incoherent speech, (2) strange behavior, (3) irregular breathing, (4) pale fixed facial expression, (5) jerky motions that are either delayed or too rapid. (E) If any of these are present, incapacitation must be suspected and action taken to check the state of the crew member.  (F) If a crew member feels unfit or unwell, he shall inform the other crew member(s) immediately.    \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 425 | Total Page: 623 \n8.3.14.3 Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Incapacitation of a Flight Crew Member In-Flight  (A) In case of incapacitation of any flight crew member during the flight, the basic principles defined under Subchapter 8.3.14.5.2 and Subchapter 8.3.19.1 shall be implemented.

Laptop computers, tablets and other battery-operated devices are often powered by one or more battery packs that contain multiple lithium ion batteries or cells.  (B) Flight crew members can carry lithium battery powered devices and their spare lithium batteries during the flight as long as the Watt hours (Wh) of its battery do not exceed 100 for lithium ion batteries, or the lithium content does not exceed 2 grams for lithium metal batteries.  (C) Current generation PEDs use lithium ion (i.e. lithium polymer) batteries and following data can be used for judgment about the Wh rating of a PED\u2019s battery. Ipad Pro (12.9 inch): 38.5 Wh, Ipad Air 2: 27.3 Wh, MacBook Air (13 inch): 54 Wh, MacBook Pro (15 inch): 99.5 Wh. Battery information can be found at technical specifications of PED. (D) In terms of calculating the Wh of the battery, when one PED has several batteries powering it together, the addition of Wh of all the batteries powering the device must be considered.  (E) Flight crew members must be aware that lithium ion cells are flammable and capable of overheating and self-ignition. Overheating can be caused by a short circuit, overcharge, rapid discharge, extreme temperatures, mishandling or an internal defect. Overheating can cause a thermal runaway and can cause adjacent cells to overheat. This can cause a lithium battery fire to flare repeatedly as each cell overheats. (1) Fighting a fire that contains either lithium metal or lithium ion battery cells requires: (a) extinguishing the fire,  (b) moving the device out of the flight deck, if possible, and  (c) cooling the remaining cells to prevent or stop a thermal runaway. (2) It is important to take action as soon as a malfunctioning device is identified, preferably before the device catches fire. If there is no risk of injury, the first course of action should be to turn off, unplug, or remove power from the device. (3) If a PED is dropped at the flight deck, seats shall not be moved to locate it. If the seat hits the PED, it could damage the battery and cause a fire. (4) Halon, Halon replacement or a water fire extinguisher must be used to extinguish the fire and prevent the spread of the fire to other flammable materials.

(4) Halon, Halon replacement or a water fire extinguisher must be used to extinguish the fire and prevent the spread of the fire to other flammable materials. Water can react with the small amount of metallic lithium in a lithium metal battery but it is still the most effective agent for cooling the remaining cells, stopping thermal runaway, and preventing additional flare-ups. Dry powder must not be used to extinguish the fire as this may increase the likelihood that additional battery cells will reach thermal runaway. (5) Ice must not be used to cool a device with burning lithium batteries and the device must not be covered with a blanket or towel. Ice and other materials insulate the device, increasing the likelihood that additional battery cells will reach thermal runaway. (6) Commander must determine the safest course of action; moving the device out of the flight deck or leaving the device on the flight deck. Unless properly protected from the fire, an attempt to pick up or move a smoking or burning device must not be made. If a device can\u2019t be picked up, the crash axe can be used to push or pull the device from the flight deck. \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 434 | Total Page: 623 \n(7) Immediately after the fire is extinguished and the device is moved from the flight deck, if possible, a crew member should douse the device with water, a water-based extinguishing agent, or other non-alcoholic liquid to cool the battery and prevent additional battery cells from reaching thermal runaway. The use of a metal container such as a galley cart or toilet bowl for this purpose can be considered. (8) The device should be monitored for the rest of the flight.

This is especially important during non-normal situations. While the purpose of passenger announcements is mainly to offer a briefing about how the flight is carried out, they may also serve to provide more specific information during non-normal circumstances such as diversion, etc.  (B) As a matter of courtesy, the flight crew should make announcements to passengers after embarkation and before descent, unless deemed by the Commander to have a negative effect on flight safety.  Normally if flight time/conditions and workload permits, a before descent announcement should be made and must be completed before top of descent at the latest. It shall be kept in mind that a timely before descent announcement is an important triggering factor for the start of passenger and cabin readiness for landing (especially for wide body ER flights). (C) In addition to the above, any other announcements that may increase passenger satisfaction (during cruise , during unexpected weather, turbulence etc.) may be made. (D) For passenger announcements by the Commander, including the ones that address matters related to safety, turbulence, abnormal and emergency situations, the Commander may refer to LS.73.002 Announcements Guide, placed on the flight deck. (E) The Commander, shall perform the announcements first in Turkish and then in English.

(E) The Commander, shall perform the announcements first in Turkish and then in English. However, he may allow the co-pilot to make the announcements depending on the experience level of the co-pilot. (F) The Commander shall make the passenger announcements when the co-pilot is performing a line flight under supervision (LIFUS). If the Commander is not a native Turkish speaker, the co-pilot will make the passenger announcement in Turkish, and the Commander will in English. (G) The sequencing for passenger announcements: the announcement in Turkish shall be made first, followed by the announcement in English. (H) If the flight crew consists of a non-native Turkish speaker: the native Turkish speaker shall make both announcements when he is PF; when the native Turkish speaker is PM, he shall make the Turkish announcement folllowed by English version which may be completed by either PF or PM. (I) In case of cabin announcements do not give enough impression to the passengers, flight crew should make the passenger  announcement to assist the cabin crew. 8.3.16.2.1 Announcement Method (A) Basically a clean sounding PA system is necessary to deliver a comprehensible passenger announcement. Therefore, it is necessary to test the PA system during pre-flight checks.  (B) Before a passenger announcement, the flight crew member to make the announcement shall hand over his duties to the other flight crew member, put on his headset and keep speaker volume at the minimum usable level adequate to avoid interference with passenger announcement but still ensure reception of relevant communications.  (C) Flight deck chatter and background noise shall be kept at a minimum during announcement.  (D) The following are recommended methods for passenger announcements:  (1) Think about what to say beforehand. \n  EK.10. 73.001 | Revision 4  OPERATIONS MANUAL PART -A \nCHAPTER 8 \u2013 OPERATING PROCEDURES   \nQMS Document Template Number: FR.18.0001 | Revision 11 Current Page: 437 | Total Page: 623 \n(2) Instead of sounding authoritarian or prohibitive, make announcements in a conversational way. (3) Choose words carefully and pay attention to keep a steady and understandable pace through announcement. (4) Avoid jokes to prevent misunderstandings, which may be caused by certain cultural differences. (5) Present information in the most general way without going into too much detail. Passengers may misinterpret technical details.  (6) Pay close attention to the time of the day and avoid making announcements during times when passengers may be asleep.  (7) Coordinate the timing of the announcement with the cabin crew. Avoid making announcements during in-flight movies or when a cabin crew announcement is in progress. (8) Make sure that PA handset push to talk switch is pressed throughout the whole announcement otherwise in-flight movie or air-show presentation will try to resume playing. In some cases, this may cause malfunctions in the entertainment system.  (9) Exclude information, which might be inaccurate.  (10) Consider making more than one announcement when flight time is expected to exceed three hours.  (11) While on the ground, if there is a delay that is expected to be 10-15 minutes or more, the Commander should address passengers accordingly and to be repeated if necessary for furher/longer delays.

(B) For procedures and responsibilities on monitoring cosmic radiation levels, refer to Subchapter 6.1.20.  8.3.18 Policy on the Use of Autopilot and Other Auto Flight Systems 8.3.18.1 Use of Automation  (A) During flight, autopilot (A/P), flight director (F/D) and auto-thrust/auto-throttle (A/THR) should be used to the maximum extent practical.  (B) This will relieve the workload of the flight crew and give them more time to monitor instruments, ATC communications, and weather conditions and pay more attention to other aircraft.  (C) When operating in good weather and at low traffic aerodromes, the flight crew can fly the departure or arrival manually to maintain manual flying skills.  (D) Optimum use of automation requires the integrated and coordinated use of the following systems:  (1) A/P; (2) F/D;  (3) A/THR;  (4) Flight management (FMS). (E) The optimum use of automation enables the flight crew to stay ahead of the aircraft and be prepared for possible contingencies.  (F) A/P engagement should only be attempted when the F/D commands (if the F/D is on) are essentially satisfied and the aircraft flight path is under control.  (G) A/THR use is recommended during all phases of flight, if applicable.

(B) If doubt exists regarding the aircraft flight path or speed control, no attempt at reprogramming the automated systems should be made. A lower level of automation or manual flight with reference to navaids raw data should be used until time and conditions permit reprogramming the A/P, F/D or FMS.  (C) Except in non-normal aircraft behavior, A/P and A/THR must not be overridden manually.  8.3.18.3 Autopilot and Flight Director Mode Selections (A) If both autopilots are inoperative, flight duty may be accepted only if the flight time does not exceed 1 hour (flight times longer than 1 hour are subject to SVP, Flight Operations (Chief Pilot)\u2019s approval). (B) The use and operation of the auto flight system must be monitored and supervised by the PF and PM at all times by:  (1) confirming, checking and announcing the status of autopilot, auto throttle/ autothrust and flight director modes on the FMA (arming, engagement, etc)  (2) the PFD (FMA, speed scale and altitude scale) - guidance modes, speed and altitude targets;  (3) the ND - lateral guidance (heading, track or FMS flight plan); and (4) supervising the resulting autopilot, flight director guidance and auto throttle/ autothrust operation on the PFD and ND (pitch attitude and bank angle, speed and speed trend, altitude, vertical speed, heading or track).

(B) Runway incursions can occur for a number of reasons but in every case, can be avoided. (C) Analysis of runway incursion events has shown that a small number of fundamental contributory factors, most of which involve human error, are common to all incidents. Poor communication techniques, a failure to follow procedures correctly, poor knowledge of the aerodrome layout and loss of situational awareness all play a part.

In operational use, if a failure occurred above the alert height in one of the required redundant operational systems in the aeroplane (including, where appropriate, ground roll guidance and the reversionary mode in a hybrid system), the approach would be discontinued and a go around executed unless reversion to a higher decision height is possible. If a failure in one of the required redundant operational systems occurred below the alert height, it would be ignored and the approach continued. (B) All Weather Operations: any takeoff or landing operations in conditions where visual reference is limited by weather conditions.  (C) Fail-Passive Flight Control System: a flight control system is fail-passive if, in the event of a failure, there is no significant out-of-trim condition or deviation of flight path or attitude but the landing is not completed automatically. For a fail-passive automatic flight control system the pilot assumes control of the aircraft after a failure. (D) Fail-Operational Flight Control System: a flight control system is fail-operational if, in the event of a failure below alert height, the approach, flare and landing can be completed automatically by the remaining part of the automatic system, which becomes a fail-passive system.  8.4.2 Aerodrome Related Requirements (A) An aerodrome may not be used for low visibility operations (LVO) below a visibility of 800 m unless:  (1) the aerodrome has been approved for such operations by the State of the aerodrome;", "doc_id": "9a85edf8-3ece-4f21-b6c9-0221c1f2a215", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e0859300af6345881a034bed88860b235ec1803ade49519cf94ad931f787dc56", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 654424, "end": 657948}, "relationships": {"1": "5c180bdc-4523-424b-9df1-d40ccb081558", "2": "7ab5bffd-88cf-4cd9-bde1-d7ae73c4bf2b", "3": "229fa323-3d05-4e32-8eb7-a3c712f9e82b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "229fa323-3d05-4e32-8eb7-a3c712f9e82b": {"__data__": {"text": "the event of a failure below alert height, the approach, flare and landing can be completed automatically by the remaining part of the automatic system, which becomes a fail-passive system.  8.4.2 Aerodrome Related Requirements (A) An aerodrome may not be used for low visibility operations (LVO) below a visibility of 800 m unless:  (1) the aerodrome has been approved for such operations by the State of the aerodrome; and  (2) low visibility procedures have been established.

The following shall be considered as possible failure scenarios occurring at the Critical Point (CP): (1)  Rapid decompression only. (2)  Engine failure + rapid decompression. (B) Based on one-engine-out diversion speed either one of the last two scenarios (1-engine and 2-engine diversion at FL 100 or MEA/MORA) may happen to be the critical fuel scenario. The critical fuel scenario is assessed by computing the required diversion fuel in accordance with the diversion profiles defined in Operations Manual Part-B and in accordance with Turkish Airlines ETOPS fuel policy.   8.5.2.5.2 Dispatch Fuel Requirements (A) ETOPS fuel planning is composed of two parts:  (1) The first part corresponds to a standard fuel scenario from the departure aerodrome to the Critical Point (CP). (2) The second part corresponds to the critical fuel scenario from the Critical Point (CP) to the diversion aerodrome. (B) Diversion fuel from each ETP to the diversion aerodrome shall be calculated in line with the ETOPS Critical Fuel Scenario and shall include the ETOPS critical fuel reserves.  The most critical ETP point in terms of this diversion fuel requirement is the Critical Point (CP). ETOPS fuel planning must be compared to the normal standard applicable fuel requirement (i.e. from the departure to the destination and destination alternate).  If it is determined by this comparison, that the ETOPS fuel planning exceeds the requirement for normal operation, additional fuel is to be carried to safely complete the Critical Fuel Scenario. (C) Fuel calculations may be manually performed by the dispatcher or the flight crew. 8.5.2.5.3 ETOPS Critical Fuel Reserves  (A) For the computation of the ETOPS critical fuel reserves and of the complete ETOPS critical fuel planning, the diversion fuel shall include the following fuel provisions: (1) Fuel burn-off from the Critical Point (CP) to the end of descent (e.g. 1500 ft) above the en-route alternate aerodrome in accordance with the Critical Fuel Scenario (one or two engines operative at the associated speed and at cruising flight level FL100 or higher if supplemental oxygen on board allows it). (2) 5% of the above fuel burn-off, as contingency fuel. (3) 5% fuel mileage penalty or a demonstrated performance factor. (4) 15 minutes holding at 1500 ft over en-route alternate aerodrome at green dot speed/minimum clean speed. (5) First approach with a go-around and a second approach.

(D) Commander authority in reference to the MEL: (1) Commander retains the final discretion to accept and operate the aeroplane in accordance with the MEL.  (2) Regardless of the conditions listed in the MEL, the Commander is not obliged to operate with a particular defect or defects which he thinks could adversely affect the safety of a proposed flight. (3) The decision of the Commander of the flight to have inoperative items corrected prior to flight has precedence over the provision contained in the MEL.  (4) Commander may request requirements above the minimum listed in the MEL whenever, in his judgement, such added equipment is essential to the safety of a particular flight under the special conditions prevailing at the time. (5) Commander shall always take into account operational constraints imposed on him as a consequence of having to operate with inoperative equipment. Individual items of the MEL might be safe but multiple MEL items, when combined, may compound to an unsafe operational condition. (6) Commander shall never accept conditions which are less than as listed in the MEL. (E) Maintenance, ferry, and test flights may be dispatched with less than the equipment specified in the MEL, provided all equipment expected to be utilized in that flight is operable.

(B) For the above reasons, the amount of first-aid oxygen should be calculated for the part of the flight after cabin depressurization during which the cabin altitude is between 8.000 ft and 15.000 ft, when supplemental oxygen may no longer be available. (C) Moreover, following cabin depressurization an emergency descent should be carried out to the lowest altitude compatible with the safety of the flight. In addition, in these circumstances, the aeroplane should land at the first available aerodrome at the earliest opportunity.
